# Welcome to CANVAS SPACE SHOOTING

Hi!  my first html canvas **game**, I have created this using vanilla JavaScript 

You can see the **Control** and **Rules** below


# Brief
Earth is under attack by aliens, but you managed to capture one of their UFOs. The only way to save earth is to destroy any UFOs that come close to your UFO. If any UFOs touch your UFO, you won't be able to capture UFO again and you will lose.

So All the Bestâ€¦.

# Rules

 1. Killing each enemy will give you **10 points**.
 2. As soon as another UFO touches you , you will lose the game.
 

## Controls

**Left** Click to attack with **Light Weapon** 

**ENJOY**
